> ### ABOUT MYSELF :  

I am 27 and currently I am working as an architect at APA Wojciechowski (largest architectural firm in Poland with over 100 employees).  

My goal is to learn web development and to be able to create web and cross platform applications. I decided to start with front-end development, because for me it's very important to interract with visual part. Also I want to understand all aspects of development (front-end, back-end as well as design process in figma).

Sense of style, artistic approach and ability to create different concepts in short deadlines are definitely my most valuable assets, which I earned working as an architectural designer.
